# Personal Finance CLI Application - Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have:
1. **Java 24** or later installed (required)
2. **Gradle Wrapper** is included (no need to install Gradle separately)

## Quick Setup

### Option 1: Using Gradle Wrapper (Recommended)

The project includes a Gradle wrapper, so you don't need to install Gradle separately.

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\SG2952\Desktop\projects\personal financing"
```

2. Build the project:
```powershell
.\gradlew.bat build
```

3. Run tests to verify everything works:
```powershell
.\gradlew.bat test
```

4. Run the application (Note: For interactive CLI, see Option 3):
```powershell
.\gradlew.bat run
```

### Option 2: Using Gradle (if installed)

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\SG2952\Desktop\projects\personal financing"
```

2. Build the project:
```powershell
gradle build
```

3. Run the application:
```powershell
gradle run
```

### Option 3: Direct JAR Execution (Best for Interactive CLI)

After building the project, run the JAR directly for proper terminal interaction:

1. Build the project:
```powershell
.\gradlew.bat build
```

2. Run the application directly:
```powershell
java -jar build\libs\personal-financing-1.0.0.jar
```

### Option 4: Using VS Code

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Install the Java Extension Pack if not already installed
3. Use Ctrl+Shift+P and run "Java: Build Projects"
4. Use Ctrl+Shift+P and run "Java: Run Application"

### Option 5: Direct Java Compilation

If you don't have Gradle installed, you can compile and run the project directly with Java:

1. Create the classes directory:
```powershell
mkdir build\classes -Force
```

2. Compile the Java files (you'll need the dependencies in a lib directory):
```powershell
javac -d build\classes -cp "lib\*" (Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*.java" src\main\java).FullName
```

3. Run the application:
```powershell
java -cp "build\classes;lib\*" com.enterprise.personalfinance.PersonalFinanceApplication
```

## Gradle Wrapper Information

This project includes a complete Gradle wrapper setup:
- **gradlew.bat** - Windows batch script to run Gradle
- **gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar** - Gradle wrapper JAR
- **gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties** - Wrapper configuration

The wrapper uses **Gradle 8.5** and will automatically download and cache Gradle if needed.

## Running the Application

### Recommended Method (Interactive CLI)

For the best interactive experience, run the JAR directly:

```powershell
# Build the project first
.\gradlew.bat build

# Run the application
java -jar build\libs\personal-financing-1.0.0.jar
```

### Alternative Methods

1. **Using Gradle wrapper:**
   ```powershell
   .\gradlew.bat run
   ```
   *Note: Interactive input may not work properly through Gradle*

2. **Using VS Code:**
   - Use the Run/Debug buttons in the editor
   - Or use Command Palette: "Java: Run Application"

### Building and Testing

```powershell
# Clean and build
.\gradlew.bat clean build

# Run tests only
.\gradlew.bat test

# View test results
.\gradlew.bat test --info
```

## Application Usage

Once the application starts, you'll see a menu with the following options:

1. **Add Expense** - Record a new expense
2. **View All Expenses** - Display all recorded expenses
3. **View Expenses by Category** - Filter by category
4. **View Expenses by Date Range** - Filter by date range
5. **Generate Financial Summary** - Show financial overview
6. **View Expenses by Category Summary** - Category totals
7. **Delete Expense** - Remove a specific expense
8. **Delete All Expenses** - Clear all data
9. **Exit** - Close the application

## Data Storage

- Expenses are stored in `expenses.json` in the project root directory
- The file is created automatically on first run
- Data persists between application sessions

## Troubleshooting

### Java Version Issues
```bash
java -version
```
Ensure you're running Java 24 or later.

### Compilation Issues
Make sure all dependencies are in the classpath and the source files are properly structured.

### File Permission Issues
Ensure the application has write permissions in the project directory for creating the expenses.json file.
